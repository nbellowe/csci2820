The answer is that it's because they're incredibly rare.  If you were to randomly generate square matrices, the chance that you would generate one that, given a rhs vector, has no solution or infintiely many solutions is basically zero.  This is not to say that **singular** systems never occur in practice.  There are many science and engineering problems that yield singular matrices. "
