    "Linear algebra is the workhorse of mathematics, especially in the computational sciences.  In most computer simulations (physics simulation, big data analysis, Netflix, Google, video and audio compression, etc) 99% of simulation time is spent solving linear algebraic sytems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can this be? In high school you were mostly exposed to very tiny matrices.  2x2's, 3x3's, maybe 4x4's if your teacher was really mean.  But in real engineering applications you have to think bigger.  One way that Netflix might decide which movies to recommend to you involves analyzing a gigantic matrix where the rows represent each movie in the Netflix library and the columns represent each of their user's ratings of those movies.  To determine which webpages should come first in a Google search, they build a big matrix where each row and column represent a page on the web.  At last count (depending on the source) there were 30-50 **billion** pages in Google's search index.  That means it Google has to do analysis on a 30-50 billion by 30-50 billion matrix! \n",
    "\n",
    "So, Google, big data, physics simulations... all of these things positively rely on sophisticated linear algebra techniques.  But before we can get to any of these, we need to have a firm grasp on the basic principles, which is what we'll cover in this class. "

    "\n",
    "OK, so vectors are a handy way of storing lists of information, but there's not really any math there.  We want to do things like add, subtract, and multiply vectors.  Let's start with adding.  \n",
